<h1>COMP 20: Web Programming</h1>
<h2>Assignment 3: The Server for the Private Car Service</h2>
<h2>Due: Tuesday, April 9th</h2>

<p class="note">This assignment is worth 25 points. You must work on this assignment individually.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>
<ul>
<li>Develop a server-side web application using Heroku, Node.js, and the Express web framework.</li>
<li>Enable and use Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).</li>
<li>Read and write data to a MongoDB database.</li>
<li>Build JSON-based APIs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>In <a href="a2.html">Assignment 2</a>, you sent your username, latitude, and longitude to a web application server (i.e., <code>https://hans-moleman.herokuapp.com/</code>), and it responded with a gob of data, where others in the class er I mean passengers or vehicles, in JSON format.  In this assignment, you will write a web application that is almost exactly like that used for Assignment 2, and deploy it.</p>

<p>Using Heroku, Node.js with the Express web framework, and MongoDB, you are to build a web application server that maintains and serves locations of passengers and vehicles (username, latitude, and longitude) for a long period of time.</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<ol>
<li class="note">For this assignment, you will not be using your private GitHub repository!</li>
<li>Do <a href="lab-nodejsheroku.html">Lab 7</a> ASAP.  Use the web application you create in the lab for this assignment.</li>
<li>You will need to use the mLab MongoDB plugin add-on for your web application.  See <a href="https://elements.heroku.com/addons/mongolab" target="_blank">https://elements.heroku.com/addons/mongolab</a>.  Run <code>heroku addons:create mongolab:sandbox</code> inside of your Heroku app folder (the one you used for Lab 7).  This will enable MongoDB for your web application on Heroku.  There is a 500 MB limit for data storage, more than enough for our needs.  If you forget to add a MongoDB plugin for your web application, your web application will return errors.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Data Description</h2>
<p>Your web application shall work with two sets of data: <code>vehicles</code> and <code>passengers</code>.  In MongoDB, a set of data is known as a <span class="stress">collection</span>.  If you are familiar with relational databases, a collection is analogous to a "table".  The collection contains a number of records, properly known as <span class="stress">documents</span>.  If you are familiar with relational databases, a document is analogous to a "row".</p>
<p>Each document will have the data field <code>_id</code> (the document's unique field, primary key) created automatically.</p>

<h3>The Keys for a Single Document in <code>vehicles</code> and <code>passengers</code></h3>
<p>The data that must be stored in one document (or record) in <code>vehicles</code> and <code>passengers</code> collections are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>username</code> - The username of driver or passenger.  See <a href="#vehicles">below</a> for whitelist of all the usernames of drivers / vehicles. <span class="note">Important: the value must be stored in the database as a string!</span></li>
<li><code>lat</code> - The user's latitude. <span class="note">Important: the value must be stored in the database as a floating point <em>number</em>!</span></li>
<li><code>lng</code> - The user's longitude. <span class="note">Important: the value must be stored in the database as a floating point <em>number</em>!</span></li>
<li><code>created_at</code> - The timestamp, generated for each new record entry.  The value for this field shall be generated on the server side.  Use the JavaScript <code>Date</code> object to generate timestamp.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="vehicles">Whitelist of all Vehicles</h2>
<p>The following is the list of all the vehicles that were used in Assignment 2.  Use this list to check if username is a driver / vehicle:</p>
<p><code>var vehicles = ["JANET","NgfcWZmS", "tNEh59TC", "suFKyeZg", "VMerzMH8", "6tWDkKh6", "ajNnfhJj", "bCxY6mCw", "Cq4NX9eE", "mXfkjrFw", "EMYaM9D8", "nZXB8ZHz", "Tkwu74WC", "TnA763WN", "TaR8XyMe", "5KWpnAJN", "uf5ZrXYw"]</code></p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>Your web application shall have the following features or APIs (Application Programming Interfaces):</p>
<h3>1. A <code>POST /rides</code> API</h3>
<p>Returns a JSON string.  Submits check-in from any domain.  The required fields and <span class="stress">exact field names</span> for submission to this API are <code>username</code>, <code>lat</code>, and <code>lng</code>.  Successful submission of these three pieces of data shall result in one entry into either the collection <code>vehicles</code> (if <code>username</code> is <a href="#vehicles">in the list above</a>) or <code>passengers</code> (otherwise) in MongoDB.</p>
<p>If a submission is missing any one of the required fields, do not insert new record into the database and send the following JSON as the response: <code>{"error":"Whoops, something is wrong with your data!"}</code>.</p>
<p>Upon successful insertion of record into <code>vehicles</code> collection (i.e., username is a driver / vehicle), return a JSON string that is an object with the key <code>passengers</code> and the corresponding value is a list of all passengers who have requested a vehicle <em>within the last three minutes</em>.  Example JSON response, same as the one seen in the Assignment 2 specification: <code>{"passengers":[{"_id":"589bd3258451126182dfbc63","username":"dwR3TbOH","lat":20.3,"lng":20.4,"created_at":"2019-03-09T02:25:41.166Z"}]}</code></p>
<p>Upon successful insertion of record into <code>passengers</code> collection (i.e., username is NOT a driver / vehicle), return a JSON string that is an object with the key <code>vehicles</code> and the corresponding value is a list of all drivers / vehicles who have been seen <em>within the last three minutes</em>.  Example JSON response, same as the one seen in the Assignment 2 specification: <code>{"vehicles":[{"_id":"589bd30f8451126182dfbc62","username":"suFKyeZg","lat":10.1,"lng":10.2,"created_at":"2019-03-09T02:25:19.575Z"}]}</code></p>
<p><span class="note">IMPORTANT: Cross-origin resource sharing must be enabled for this API, else data cannot be sent from another domain (i.e., your Assignment 2 map will not work).</span></p>
<p>Multiple check-ins for a username is allowed.</p>

<h3>2. A <code>GET /passenger.json</code> API</h3>
<p>Returns a list of all records for a given username as a JSON string if record(s) exist in MongoDB collection <code>passengers</code>.  The mandatory parameter for this API is <code>username</code>.  If the <code>username</code> query parameter is empty, not provided, or no results found, return empty JSON list <code>[]</code>.</p>
<p>Example output 1: <code>GET /passenger.json?username=tNEh59TC</code> returns <code>[]</code> (as <code>tNEh59TC</code> is a vehicle)</p>
<p>Example output 2: <code>GET /passenger.json?username=dwR3TbOH</code> returns something like <code>[{"_id":"589bd3258451126182dfbc63","username":"dwR3TbOH","lat":20.3,"lng":20.4,"created_at":"2019-03-09T02:25:41.166Z"}]</code></p>
<p>Example output 3: <code>GET /passenger.json</code> returns <code>[]</code> as no username was given.</p>
<p class="note">Cross-origin resource sharing must be enabled for this API else another another domain cannot retrieve data.</p>

<h3>3. <code>GET /</code> - Home, the root, the index</h3>
<p>Returns HTML.  You may also use additional JavaScript and CSS, and you are free to design this page however you desire. Accessing this on a web browser (e.g., <code>https://NAMEOFYOURHEROKUAPP.herokuapp.com/</code>) shall display list of all the vehicles in the database <span class="stress">in descending order</span> by timestamp (that is, the last driver/vehicle who was looking for passengers is displayed first).  username, and check-in timestamp must be displayed in addition to the location (latitude and longitude).  Simply outputting JSON as the page is unacceptable.</p>

<p>Example output: <code>suFKyeZg was looking for passengers at 10.1, 10.2 on 2019-03-09T02:25:19.575Z</code>.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>With the exception of the data requirements (in "Data Description" above), please note that I did not mention a thing about security or error handling in the requirements.  Authentication to this web application is not required.  There is a reason for this, as you will see in Assignment 4.</p>
